*Note:* You can remove the local database and check if the pull replication retrieves the documents now present on Sync Gateway.
On macOS, use the https://simpholders.com/[SimPholders] utility app to quickly find the data directory of the application and delete the database called **user1**.
Then restart the app and you'll notice that the "Today" list isn't displayed.
That is, the list document wasn't replicated from Sync Gateway to Couchbase Lite.
Indeed, the document is not routed to a channel that the user has access to. *Channel* and *access* are new terms so don't worry, we'll cover what they mean in the next section.

Here's a table that compares the Live Preview Mode and Deploy To Server.
For channel and access changes, the Live Preview Mode is very useful.
Just make sure to copy the changes to your config file once you're done!

As you have learned in this section, writing a sync function for each document type is done in 4 stages: write permissions, validating changes, routing, read permissions.

If a document makes it through step 1 and 2 it will be written to Sync Gateway.
Step 3 and 4 are used to defined the access control. 

In the next section you will learn how to encrypt the local database on the device to provide additional security. 

== Database Encryption

The Couchbase Lite API allows you to encrypt the database on the device.
By providing an encryption key, all the data stored in the database will be secure.
To decrypt it in the future, the same key must be used. 

[quote]
*Note:* There are two storage types available in Couchbase Lite, _ForestDB_ and __SQLite__.
This tutorial only covers _SQLite_ but you can refer to the documentation to find the instructions to include _ForestDB_ in your project. 

You must first include the correct dependencies before enabling encryption.

* Locate the `openDatabase(username:withKey:newKey)` method in **AppDelegate.swift**, this method is called from `startSession` which is in turn getting called in `processLogin` after the user has logged in. 
* The manager's `openDatabaseName` is used to create an encrypted database. 


[source]

let dbname = username
let options = CBLDatabaseOptions()
options.create = true

if kEncryptionEnabled {
    if let encryptionKey = key {
        options.encryptionKey = encryptionKey
    }
}

try database = CBLManager.sharedInstance().openDatabaseNamed(dbname, withOptions: options)
if newKey != nil {
    try database.changeEncryptionKey(newKey)

* Locate the `OpenDatabase(string, string, string)` method in **CoreApp.cs**, this method is called from `StartSession` which is in turn getting called from the login page's logic. 
* The manager's `OpenDatabase` is used to create an encrypted database.

var encryptionKey = default(SymmetricKey);
if(key != null) {
    encryptionKey = new SymmetricKey(key);

var options = new DatabaseOptions {
    Create = true,
    EncryptionKey = encryptionKey

=== Try it out


// <block class="ios"/>


* Drag *Extras/libsqlcipher.a* from the Couchbase Lite SDK folder to the Frameworks folder in the Xcode project. image:img/image50.png[]
* In the *Build Phases* tab, remove *libsqlite3.tbd* from the *Link Binary With Libraries* section and add **libsqlcipher.a**. image:https://cl.ly/1K2Q1k3V473l/image49.gif[]
* Set `kEncryptionEnabled` to true in **AppDelegate.swift**. 

`swift   let kEncryptionEnabled = true`

* Delete the application if you ran it previously without encryption. 
+
// <img src="img/image17.png" class="portrait"/>
* Build and run. 
* Browse to the database file and you'll find that it's now encrypted. 


// <block class="net"/>


* In the `CreateHint()` method in **CoreApp.cs**, change `EncryptionEnabled = false` to `EncryptionEnabled = true`
+

[source,c#]
----

var retVal = new CoreAppStartHint {
    LoginEnabled = false,
    EncryptionEnabled = true, // Line to change is here
    SyncEnabled = false,
    UsePrebuiltDB = false,
    ConflictResolution = false,
    Username = "todo"
};

return retVal;

* Delete the application if you ran it previously without encryption. 


// <block class="wpf"/>


* Delete the database file with the username in question from the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` folder if you previous ran without encryption 


// <block class="net"/>


* Build and run. 
* Browse to the database file and you'll find that it's now encrypted.

== Offline Login

What about the scenario where a user attempts to login while being offline? Since data may already be in the database, it would be nice to allow the app to use it.
From the previous section, you`'ve learned that the database can be safely accessed with an encryption key so the user can attempt to enter credentials as if they were online (the *name* and *password* of the Sync Gateway user). To achieve offline login, you are mapping the user`'s *name* to be the *database name* and the user`'s *password* to be the **encryption key**. 

If the user enters an incorrect password (that is not the valid encryption key), the database will return an error with a status code of 401 to indicate it`'s the wrong password. 

To make it even more challenging, consider the scenario where a user`'s password has been modified on Sync Gateway.
Since the encryption key is the old password it will not be accessible, so when the user`'s password changes on Sync Gateway the local encryption key and server password will be out of sync.
To detect that, you`'re going to use the replication change event and check for the status code.
If it`'s a 401, you will logout the user and display the login screen.
However, the data stored in the database will have changes that were not pushed to Sync Gateway yet.
You can offer users the ability to update the encryption key only if they remember their old password (because it`'s the only way to open and read data from the database encrypted with the old password). If they don`'t remember it, the changes made while they were offline will be lost.
The marble diagram below shows every scenario and outcome. 


// <img src="img/image24.png" class="center-image"/>

In **AppDelegate.swift**, scroll to the `processLogin` method.
Notice that if an error with status 401 is thrown it calls `handleEncryptionError` which displays a popup with an input text and two options. 


// <img src="img/image27.png" class="portrait"/>

When the user clicks *Delete* it will remove the database and create a new one with no data in it.
If the user remembers the old password and clicks *Migrate* it will call the `processLogin` method again passing it the old and new encryption keys.
The following code at the end of the `openDatabase` method is changing that encryption key to the user's new password. 


// <block class="ios"/>


[source]
----

if newKey != nil {
    try database.changeEncryptionKey(newKey)
}
----


// <block class="net"/>


[source,c#]
----

if(newKey != null) {
    Database.ChangeEncryptionKey(new SymmetricKey(newKey));
}
----


// <block class="all"/>

Build and run.
Change the password for the user with the following curl request. 

[source,bash]
----

curl -vX PUT 'http://localhost:4985/todo/_user/user1' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"name": "user1","password": "newpass"}'
----

Add a new list which will wake up the replicator to push the new document.
Since the user credentials have changed, the task list will not be persisted to Sync Gateway.
The way to get notified of this is by checking the replication `lastError` property in the replication change event.
In this case it will be a **401 Unauthorized**. 


// <block class="ios"/>

The *lastError* property is checked in the `replicationProgress` method of **AppDelegate.swift**. 

[source]
----

func replicationProgress(notification: NSNotification) {
    UIApplication.sharedApplication().networkActivityIndicatorVisible =
        (pusher.status == .Active || puller.status == .Active)
    let error = pusher.lastError ?? puller.lastError
    if (error != syncError) {
        syncError = error
        if let errorCode = error?.code {
            NSLog("Replication Error: %@", error!)
            if errorCode == 401 {
                Ui.showMessageDialog(
                    onController: self.window!.rootViewController!,
                    withTitle: "Authentication Error",
                    withMessage:"Your username or password is not correct.",
                    withError: nil,
                    onClose: {
                        self.logout()
                })
            }
        }
    }
}
----

If the error code is 401 it displays the popup below and logs the user out of the application. 


// <img src="./img/image18.png" class="portrait"/>


// <block class="net"/>

The *LastError* property is checked in the `HandleReplicationChanged` method of **CoreApp.cs**. 

[source,c#]
----

private static void HandleReplicationChanged(object sender, ReplicationChangeEventArgs args)
{
    var error = Interlocked.Exchange(ref _syncError, args.LastError);
    if(error != args.LastError) {
        var errorCode = (args.LastError as CouchbaseLiteException)?.CBLStatus?.Code;
        if(errorCode == StatusCode.Unauthorized) {
            _dialogs.ShowError("Authorization failed: Your username or password is not correct.");
        }
    }
}
----

If the error code is 401 it displays the popup below. 


// <block class="all"/>

Click *OK* and on the login screen type *user1* and **newpass**, the new password on the login screen. 


// <img src="./img/image00.png" class="portrait"/>

Click **Login**.
Next, type *pass* on the "Password Changed" popup, the previous password. 


// <img src="./img/image14.png" class="portrait"/>

Click **Migrate**.
Notice that the list added after the password changed is there. 


// <img src="./img/image10.png" class="portrait"/>


=== Key Rotation

Key rotation is defined as the process of decrypting data with an old key and re-keying the data with a new one.
The benefits of key rotation are all centered on security; for example, if the password to sensitive data is being shared between many users, you may decide to use key rotation to add an extra layer of security.
By regularly changing the password you will mitigate the scenario where the encryption key can be compromised unknowingly.
Rotating your keys offers more protection and better security for your sensitive business data, but it is not a requirement and it should be considered on a per-application basis.
