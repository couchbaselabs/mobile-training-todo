= Scale

In this lesson you'll learn how to scale Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server in real-time with zero downtime. 

== Requirements

Three instances with the following: 

* Centos 7 
* RAM >= 2GB 


== Getting Started

This lesson contains some scripts to automatically deploy and configure Sync Gateway with Couchbase Server.
Download those scripts on each VM using wget. 

[source,bash]
----

ssh vagrant@192.168.34.11
wget https://cl.ly/1q300A3v3R1D/deploy.zip
sudo yum install -y unzip
unzip deploy.zip
----

Throughout this lesson, you will use different scripts located in the *deploy* folder. 

== Architecture

In this lesson you will deploy a 3rd Sync Gateway node behind the reverse proxy.

== Scaling Sync Gateway

Similarly to previous lessons you will first deploy Sync Gateway with the configuration file passing the IP of the VM running Couchbase Server. 

There will be 3 Sync Gateway nodes but the reverse proxy is forwarding the load to only 2 of them.
To balance the traffic across all 3 you must update the NGINX config file with the IP of VM5. 

=== Try it out

. Log on VM5 (sync-gateway). 
. `cd deploy`
. Run the Sync Gateway install latest script passing the IP of VM1 where Couchbase Server is running. 
+

[source,bash]
----

sudo ./install_latest_sync_gateway.sh VM1
----
. Log on VM4 (nginx). 
. Run the NGINX install script passing the IP of VM2, VM3 and VM4 where the Sync Gateway instances are running. 
+

[source,bash]
----

sudo ./configure_nginx.sh VM2 VM3 VM5
----
. Send a curl request to http://localhost:8000. This will return information about the running sync_gateway behind the reverse proxy. 
+

[source,bash]
----

curl localhost:8000
----
+
